# sanalog.net
Personal website. Currently in not-so-active development (as of Mar 2024).

For an actual description of the site, purpose, development and whatnot, check [sanalog.net/blog/code/sanalog.net](https://sanalog.net/blog/code/sanalog.net).

I use [Tape](https://www.aeriform.io/tape) as a progress tracker, but there is also a [Notion page](https://sanalog.notion.site/41438cc18d254359a2620640e9653f24?v=31d989b6593c4f40920ea8208f11855f) in case anyone cares.

One day I will get better at talking to computers and hopefully do some [cool stuff](https://webring.xxiivv.com/). Right now both this site and I are too much of a mess to do anything. I plan to overhaul the site with [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/) before achieving Zen and making my page a single markdown file. This will take ~15 years.

I would also like to upgrade my [home server]() and host sanalog.net myself, but that is not currently viable.
