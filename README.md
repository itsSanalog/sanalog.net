# [sanalog.net](https://sanalog.net)
Personal website. Currently not in development because of military service (as of Jul 2024).

For an actual description of the site, purpose, development and whatnot, check [sanalog.net/blog/code/sanalog.net](https://sanalog.net/blog/code/sanalog.net).

I use [Tape](https://www.aeriform.io/tape) as a progress tracker, but there is also a [to-do page](https://sanalog.net/blog/todo) in case anyone cares.

One day I will get better at talking to computers and hopefully do some [cool stuff](https://webring.xxiivv.com/). Right now both this site and I are too much of a mess to do anything. I plan to overhaul the site with ~~[Svelte](https://svelte.dev/)~~ [Astro](https://astro.build/) before achieving Zen and making my page a single markdown file. This will take ~51 years.

I would also like to host sanalog.net [myself](https://sanalog.net/blog/code/server), but that is not currently viable.
