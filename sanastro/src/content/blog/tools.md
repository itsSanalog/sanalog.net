# Computers

## Sanalog-PC (desktop + peripherals)

I use this machine for most things, whenever possible. It was a modest build when I chose the parts and built it back in March 2021, and a bit dated now. Regardless, it fulfills all my needs, I love it, and don't plan to replace any parts anytime soon. It runs Windows 10.

It took over four months the twenty-seventh iteration of a parts list before my dad got sick of me and offered to pay for the case if I just bought the damn thing. I've been using it as is ever since.

## Sanalog-II (laptop)

The ASUS S5602ZA is my primary laptop for all boring and on-the-go tasks. Coming into university, I was adamant that my first laptop from 2015 would suffice. I was wrong, and bought this one within a month of school starting.

It was purchased in 2022 through a Korean retailer, as they come with Hangul legends and without Windows, saving me extra. For ₩1,050,000 (~770 USD) I was able to get a 12700H and a 4K OLED screen, with solid build quality and a decent keyboard. With such value you'd expect me to love it, but I'll never forgive it for replacing my previous laptop.

| Specs | |
|:---|:---|
CPU  | Intel i7-12700H
RAM  | 16 GB DDR4 (8 GB soldered + 8 GB SODIMM)
SSD  | 512 GB M.2 PCIe 4.0 NVMe 
Display | 16.0 inch 3840×2400 (16:10!) 60 Hz OLED, 600-nit HDR
Battery | 70 Wh which doesn't last long in 4K
I/O | 2x USB-A, 2x Thunderbolt 4, HDMI 2.1,  3.5 mm. Very good.

## sanalog-server (home server)

That first laptop which got obsolesced? *<span class="smaller muted">my baby</span>* It's the Samsung NT910S5K, and it lives as a server now. I wrote [a detailed post about the setup](/blog/code/server).

| Specs | |
|:---|:---|
CPU  | Intel i5-5200U
RAM  | 8 GB LPDDR3 1600 MHz
SSD  | 256 GB 

It runs Ubuntu Server 20.04 and CasaOS. Proxmox would be nice but CasaOS' GUI is really useful for my family to toy with the server as well.

## SisterIV (phone)

I've had four Samsung phones. I stopped rooting once OneUI was rolled out. I don't like phones that much.

# Other Electronics
*<span class="muted">most of these are technically computers</span>*
- **Fujifilm X-A3 Camera** &centerdot; semi-broken, but it works enough.
- **Hitachi VC-6025 Oscilloscope** &centerdot; somehow very useful.
- **Aiwa RX650 Cassette Player** &centerdot; fantastic little thing.
- **Moondrop Chu 2** &centerdot; lifeline.
- **Nintendo Wii** &centerdot; homebrewed. Easily the best console to exist.
- **Nintendo Switch** &centerdot; replaced the joysticks with hall effect ones.
- **Ti-83 Plus** &centerdot; the better one.
- **Ti-84 Plus CE** &centerdot; the worse one.

# Software

## Utilities

- [Calctus](https://github.com/shapoco/calctus) is a calculator app with nifty tools that has be indispensably useful for me. It's very well made and quite intuitive to use. The UI is straightforward and the English is perfect despite it being made by a Japanese developer. Comes as a single .exe file at 1.62 MB, and I have it installed on every USB drive I own. Highly recommended.

- [Left (electron)](https://100r.co/site/left_electron.html) is a plaintext editor that's very pretty yet still functional. Unfortunately it comes as a large package as it's an Electron app.

- [Tape](https://aeriform.itch.io/tape). Project management tool that's very simple and easy to use. I like it a lot.

- [Notion](https://www.notion.so/). I use this for everything. It's very slow and bloated but I'm too deep in now.

- [Spacesniffer](http://www.uderzo.it/main_products/space_sniffer/) is a disk space treemap tool like many others, but I like this one for its UI and being portable.

- [Wireshark](https://www.wireshark.org/)

- [Bitwarden](https://bitwarden.com/). Password manager.

- [7-Zip](https://www.7-zip.org/)

- [Handbrake](https://handbrake.fr/). Video transcoder.

## Development

- Adobe Creative Cloud: I use Illustrator, Lightroom, Premiere Pro, and After Effects. They all suck.

- [Clip Studio Paint](https://www.clipstudio.net/en/). Rather bloated and comes with useless cloud stuff, but solid core.

- [OKLCH Color Picker](https://oklch.com/).

- Fusion 360. This also sucks.

- [MagicaVoxel](https://ephtracy.github.io/). Amazing voxel editor + animator + renderer that comes in at only 10 MB.

- [Cadmapper](https://cadmapper.com/)

- [PICO-8](https://www.lexaloffle.com/pico-8.php) is a fantasy console that's fun to use.

- [VS Code](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode). I also use VScode for LaTeX using [TinyTeX](https://yihui.org/tinytex/).

- [Neovim](https://neovim.io/)

- [Wandbox](https://wandbox.org/) is a browser-based compiler that's very useful for quick tests.


## Windows

- [ExplorerPatcher](https://github.com/valinet/ExplorerPatcher). Pretty much a must-have for Windows 11.

- [PowerToys](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/powertoys/). Also a must-have.
