<!-- Merveilles is a collective of forward-thinking individuals who strive to better each other and their surroundings through constant creation and play. This community project is aimed at the establishment of new ways of speaking, seeing and organizing. A warm welcome to any like-minded people who feel these ideals resonate with them.

We're trying to build a community that welcomes multidisciplinarity, with somewhat high standards of discourse, focusing on the topics of experimental art, music & code. We ask of our members to consider the impact of their works on the environment, and to optimize toward living more sustainably. -->
