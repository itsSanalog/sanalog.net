# Kochab

The Kochab code governs design.

# Pherkad

The Pherkad code governs content.

##### Ensure optimal presentation.


- prioritise human readable formats

With images or other visual media:
- be sensible in choosing between vectors and rasters
- be reasonable with fidelity and compression

##### Create content that is accurate and correct.

There is no place for content that is made to mislead or misinform.

##### Create content that is welcoming, accessible, and enjoyable.



##### Credit sources.

# Yildun

The Yildun code governs the credo.

##### Do not misuse the credo.

The credo is not to be *followed*. The credo is not a railway track. The credo is not an eventual destination, nor is it a starting point.

##### The credo is not immutable.

The credo changes.

This community project is aimed at the establishment of new ways of speaking, seeing and organizing. A warm welcome to any like-minded people who feel these ideals resonate with them.

We're trying to build a community that welcomes multidisciplinarity, with somewhat high standards of discourse, focusing on the topics of experimental art, music & code. We ask of our members to consider the impact of their works on the environment, and to optimize toward living more sustainably. -->
