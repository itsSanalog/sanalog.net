A set of beliefs and waypoints.

# Introduction

I enjoy learning. I enjoy experiencing things, especially regarding creative media.

My work processes favour creativity and innovative approaches to tasks. This is accompanied by heavy, yet uncluttered documentation with a focus on clarity. I try to apply the various knowledge and skills I have acquired in the past, gaining a deeper understanding of them in the process.

It is thus not surprising that I have an intense ardour for <a target="_blank" class="extlink" href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/255132.The_Medici_Effect">intellectual cross-pollination</a>.

> In a wicked world, relying upon experience from a single domain is not only limiting, it can be disastrous.

I created the credo to remind myself of the things I love and how I should act. The credo is split into four codes. Their names borrow inspiration from the little bear (little dipper) constellation, as an homage to seafarers using the perpetually visible to safeguard themselves on their parlous journeys.

# Polaris

The Polaris code governs behaviour.

##### Play is good.

Play is good. Play is constant creation. Play is constant problem solving and play is constant quitting. The speed and efficiency in which one gains experience through play is almost cheating.

##### Better yourself.

Anything you do, be aware of what you have earned. So much as a smile is a good enough incentive to do something.

##### Better the world.

The Confucian ideal society resonates with me, one where the people are enriched in knowledge, coexisting beyond the cofines of capital and even ownership. Why should one's knowledge be exclusively theirs? The propagation of knowledge should be catalysed by altruism. Voice your opinion and share your creations. Discourse giveth but never takeths away.

# Kochab

The Kochab code governs design.

Good design

- is innovative
- makes a product useful
- is aesthetic
- makes a product understandable
- is unobtrusive
- is honest
- is long-lasting
- is thorough down to the last detail
- is environmentally-friendly
- is as little design as possible

Additionally:

Good design should be iterated. It should be ethical. Good design should be international and non-discriminatory. Good design should be *fun*.

# Pherkad

The Pherkad code governs content.

##### Ensure optimal presentation.

There are countless approaches to this. A few out of a million things to care about:

- Practice 'correct' spelling, punctuation, and grammar.
- Prioritise human readable formats.
- Be consistent in style and hierarchy.
- Be sensible in choosing file formats (e.g. vectors/rasters).
- Be reasonable with fidelity and compression.
- Account for accessibility or technical edge cases.

##### Create content that is accurate and correct.

There is no place for content made to mislead or misinform.

##### Create content that is welcoming, accessible, and enjoyable.

Fuck discrimination. Fuck reactionaries. Fuck boring spreadsheets reporting on quarterly earnings.

##### Credit sources.

# Yildun

The Yildun code governs the credo.

##### Do not misuse the credo.

The credo is not to be *followed*. The credo is not a railway track. The credo is not an eventual destination, nor is it a starting point.

##### The credo is not immutable.

The credo changes.
