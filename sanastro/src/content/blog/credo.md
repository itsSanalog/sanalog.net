A set of beliefs and waypoints. Under construction.

# Introduction

I enjoy learning. I enjoy experiencing things, especially regarding creative media.

My work processes favour creativity and innovative approaches to tasks. This is accompanied by heavy, yet uncluttered documentation with a focus on clarity. I try to apply the various knowledge and skills I have acquired in the past, gaining a deeper understanding of them in the process.

> In a wicked world, relying upon experience from a single domain is not only limiting, it can be disastrous.

In <a target="_blank" class="extlink" href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/255132.The_Medici_Effect">*The Medici Effect*</a> enough, have an intense ardour for intellectual cross-pollination.




We're trying to build a community that welcomes multidisciplinarity, with somewhat high standards of discourse, focusing on the topics of experimental art, music & code. We ask of our members to consider the impact of their works on the environment, and to optimize toward living more sustainably. -->

# Polaris

The Polaris code governs behaviour.

##### Better yourself.

Anything you do,

##### Play is good.

Play is good. Play is constant creation. Play is constant problem solving and play is constant quitting. The speed and efficiency in which one gains experience is almost cheating.

##### Better the world.

The Confucian ideal society resonates with me, one where the people are enriched in knowledge, coexisting beyond the cofines of capital and even ownership. Why should one's knowledge be exclusively theirs? The propagation of knowledge should be catalysed by altruism. Voice your opinion and share your creations. Discourse giveth but never takeths away.

# Kochab

The Kochab code governs design.

# Pherkad

The Pherkad code governs content.

##### Ensure optimal presentation.


- prioritise human readable formats

With images or other visual media:
- be sensible in choosing between vectors and rasters
- be reasonable with fidelity and compression

##### Create content that is accurate and correct.

There is no place for content that is made to mislead or misinform.

##### Create content that is welcoming, accessible, and enjoyable.



##### Credit sources.

# Yildun

The Yildun code governs the credo.

##### Do not misuse the credo.

The credo is not to be *followed*. The credo is not a railway track. The credo is not an eventual destination, nor is it a starting point.

##### The credo is not immutable.

The credo changes.
