Say you have to make a pocket radio. You have to include a circuit board, a speaker, and two AA batteries.

<img

  alt="Example" 
  data-light="../../../assets/blog/work/design-4d/light.png" 
  data-dark="../../../assets/blog/work/design-4d/dark.png" 
  class="theme-image" 
/>
<p class="small muted c">a circuit board, a speaker, and two AA batteries</p>

Designing *as little as possible*, you'd probably go with an arrangement like this:

<picture>
  <source srcset="../../../assets/blog/work/design-4d/arrange-light.png" media="(prefers-color-scheme: light)"/>
  <source srcset="../../../assets/blog/work/design-4d/arrange-dark.png"  media="(prefers-color-scheme: dark)"/>
</picture>
