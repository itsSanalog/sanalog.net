Say you have to make a pocket radio. You have to include a circuit board, a speaker, and two AA batteries.

<p class="small muted c">a circuit board, a speaker, and two AA batteries</p>

Designing *as little as possible*, you'd probably go with an arrangement like this:

![](../../../assets/blog/work/design-4d/arrange-light.png){.theme-invert}
<style>
  body:not(.theme-light) img.theme-invert {
    filter: invert(1) hue-rotate(180deg);
  }
</style>
