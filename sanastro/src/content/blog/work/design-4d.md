Say you have to make a pocket radio. You have to include a circuit board, a speaker, and two AA batteries.

You might go with an arrangement like this:

<p class="small muted c">look at that mighty ergonomic handle</p>

Designing *as little as possible*, we can save some space by removing those ugly, unnecessary cavities:

But following good design principles, you will probably end up with this:

Indeed, this is what every sensible designer would do.

To most readers, the 'optimal' arrangement would have more than likely been visualised immediately. Indeed, this is fundamental and second nature to product designers. But I would like to investigate what exactly goes through our brains when we collectively arrive at the same answer.

Since the product is a pocket radio, portability is a high priority factor to account for when arranging components. The largest part are the PCB and the speaker, but the thickest part are the batteries. I'll thus overlap the speaker over the circuit board. The PCB could be L-shaped to accomodate the batteries. This way, not only have we minimised unused space inside the casing, but also the minimum bounding box (MBB) of the product, ensuring it fits comfortably in pockets.
