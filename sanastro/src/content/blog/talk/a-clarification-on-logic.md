What is logic? To be 'logical' in an argument is to come to that conclusion via valid relations between premises. How does it relate to emotion? Emotion is a component of instinct: we 'feel' something 'bad' but cannot explain WHY feel bad. Logic is the elucidation of this emotion; using premises, we can explain why something IS bad. Of course, this has numerous other implications. For example, our standards of 'good' and 'bad' have to be defined. There is also the importance in eloquence, for a fantastic command of language is required to express arguments in a clear fashion. Such complexities make robust discourse mentally strenuous.

But why is it important? And is sound logic worth the effort? We experience a certain event and make a certain verdict about it. However, other people have not experienced this: they are hence unable to comprehend why we consider something as such. It boils down to a difference in experience. A young, enthusiastic recruit lacks the experience of an old, grizzled soldier, and cannot comprehend why war is horrific, having only seen the glorious victory that war has produced for his country in the past.

It is unreasonable to demand of someone to simply accept that something is true based on personal emotion. Of course, this would mean that a great understanding of the REASONS behind one's emotions are required to communicate them. This, of course, is not something most people can do. Our only hope may be to practice constant introspection to better understand ourselves.
