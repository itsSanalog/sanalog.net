# who writes this crap?

*<span class="muted">..that would be me.</span>*

# What

sanaBlog or 산아록 is a website to archive and share what I [see](/blog/gallery), [write](/blog), and [use](/blog/reviews). There are notes, rants, reviews, projects, photos... many things. I try to update most of them regularly.

# Who

Sanalog is currently in active duty, cooking three meals a day for ~60 people. I am also a Field Radio Operator and Drill Instructor when they need me to be. Guess that's how it is when the entire base is ran by such few people. I update sanaBlog on my phone.

# Why

I like making things. <b style="font-family: 'Comic Neue'">Design is my passion</b>. It's a wonderful realm of countless disciplines, and the only one where I can enjoy:

- Writing
- Graphics and visualisation
- Programming
- 3D modelling
- Games

..all at once.

This site exists for me. For me to learn, remember, and reminisce (more likely, cringe at). It is a place for me to write, for its own sake, not necessarily for someone else to read. It is public though, for someone with a weird taste in reading to enjoy.

# How

Though I cannot swear by it, I will try to:

- Ensure 'correct' spelling, puntuation, grammar,
- Write content that is accurate and correct (to my best knowledge).
- Credit relevant sources.
- Be entertaining. This is very difficult.
