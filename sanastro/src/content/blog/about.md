# What

sanaBlog or 산아록 is a notebook in webpage form. It is part of sanalog.net, the personal website and playspace of Sanalog.

Its purpose is to be a secretary of sorts—a second brain. It archives various information, experiences, or emotions. It shares what I [see](/blog/gallery), [create](/blog), and [spend time with](/blog/reviews). Content comes in the form of articles, rants, reviews, stories, project logs, photos... many things. sanaBlog grows and changes as I do. As such, I try to update most content regularly.

## Meta

sanaBlog is a static site hosted on <a href="https://pages.github.com/" target="_blank" class="extlink">GitHub Pages</a>. It is built using <a href="https://astro.build/" target="_blank" class="extlink">Astro</a>, with HTML, CSS, and a touch of JavaScript. Content is written using Markdown. More details in [wesbite](/blog/code/wesbite).

# Who

Sanalog likes to play. Sanalog is:

> Currently in active duty, cooking three meals a day for ~60 people. I am also a Field Radio Operator and Drill Instructor when they need me to be. Guess that's how it is when the entire base is ran by such few people. I update sanaBlog on my phone.

Sanalog operates under the [credo](/blog/credo).

# Why

I like making things. <b style="font-family: 'Comic Neue'">Design is my passion</b>. It's a wonderful realm of countless disciplines, and the only one where I can enjoy them all at once.

This site exists for me. For me to learn, remember, and reminisce (more likely, cringe at). It is a place for me to write but not necessarily for someone else to read. It is public though, for someone with a weird taste in reading to enjoy.

# How

sanaBlog's content is created under the [Pherkad code](/blog/credo#pherkad), part of the [credo](/blog/credo).

I try to:

- Ensure 'correct' spelling, punctuation, and grammar.
- Create content that is accurate and correct to my best knowledge.
- Create content that is welcoming, accessible, and enjoyable.
- Credit relevant sources.

Questions, feedback, or suggestions are always welcome. You can <a href="mailto:me@sanalog.net">email: me (at) sanalog.net</a>.
