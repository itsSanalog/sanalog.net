Riot Grrrl resurgence. Queercore landmark. But just excellent punk, honestly.

Dazey and the Scouts were a 4.5 man band from 2016 to 2018. They released this one (fantastic) album which nobody noticed at the time, and then they disbanded. That is until 2021, when they were re-evaluated by horny and punk hungry music nerds looking for something intimate, passionate, and full of energy. Bless them, for this album is some good shit. The attention prompted the band to release physical copies, pressing nine records, a CD, and a cassette—all these years after the album's release.

# Groan

I found this album through this song, and it remains my favourite of the seven tracks. This track—and the entire album by extension—is incredibly fun. In *Groan*, instrumentals refuse to back down against the incredible vocals of Lea Jaffe, painting an image of each player letting it all out. You can only imagine how intense the energy would be in one of their basement concerts that I will unfortunately never be a part of. Vocals are clearly the highlight, full of sass and giving maximum attitude. The note at 2:28 is some stunning soprano shit.

The song is direct about its subject, unabashedly chasing inappropriate love tainted with unbalanced age and power dynamics. The magic, however, is in how you find yourself falling in with the performer rather than being an adult about it. You share the sheer desperation in being wanted. "I wanna spend the night with you" is the most straight forward way to tell how much you want someone. It is made obvious who's in the wrong, with lines like "For a girl this young, naïve, and miserable" and the repeated "You want a fresh cut flower, and I'm your sweet red rose". It's also painfully obvious that the younger one isn't manipulated, unaware, or stupid. Fully knowing how foolish she's being, She just can't give a fuck. Honestly, I'd do the same for attention that I so dearly crave.

# Maggot

Starts slow. Cardiac is a bit predictable and poppy. Actually overall track is poppy.
