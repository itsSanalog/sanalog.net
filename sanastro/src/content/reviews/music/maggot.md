Riot Grrrl resurgence. Queercore landmark. But just excellent punk, honestly.

Dazey and the Scouts were a 4.5 man band from 2016 to 2018. They released this one (fantastic) album which nobody noticed at the time, and then they disbanded. That is until 2021, when they were re-evaluated by horny and punk hungry music nerds looking for something intimate, passionate, and full of energy. Bless them, for this album is some good shit. The attention prompted the band to release physical copies, pressing nine records, a CD, and a cassetteâ€”all these years after the album's release.

# Groan

I found this album through this song, and it remains my favourite of the seven tracks. The dynamic instrumentals evoke vivid images of performers letting it all out - laughing, crying, and loving. There is no band I would rather see live for this reason. (https://rateyourmusic.com/release/album/dazey-and-the-scouts/maggot/reviews/3/)

seven songs, no skips, the entire thing bursting with talent. Opening with the heavy surf punk of Groan, primary vocalist Lea Jaffe impresses with her constantly varying delivery that is both melodic and full of attitude and the full-on opera note she hits at 2:28 drops my jaw every time.

# Wet

A low S for lyrics. Too similar otherwise. This has eleven millions plays on youtube?

# Maggot

Starts slow. Cardiac is a bit predictable and poppy. Actually overall track is poppy.
