# Rant

God I HATE the colon shenaningans that go on here.

In most places I've checked, `Velocity: Design: Comfort.` is used, with some opting for `Velocity : Design : Comfort`. I did not take cases into account. 

> Velocity : Design : Comfort (stylized as velocity: design: comfort.)

Which is stylised? Wikipedia suggests the first is. Judging from the inclusion of the period, you would expect Wikipedia to be right, but the former sports the non-standard colon usage. Funny how `Velocity : Design : Comfort.` is very rarely seen despite it being the closest to what's on the album cover.

Tracks `Pro : Lov : Ad`, `Design : I`, and `Design : 2 : 3` suffer as well. Particularly `Design : I`. I have seen:
- Design : I
- Design: I
- Design:I
- Design : 1
- Design: 1
- Design:1

Streaming services all opt for `I` in some form, but physical release information mostly prefer `1`. Hilariously, Last.fm lists <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Sweet+Trip/Velocity:+Design:+Comfort./design:+I" target="_blank" class="extlink">`design: I`</a> in the album tracklist that for some reason redirects to <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Sweet+Trip/_/Design+:+1" target="_blank" class="extlink">`Design : 1`</a>. Which is the 'main' one??

Checking every release, it seems like Darla themselves aren't quite sure either. There is no dominant occurence between colons with or without the preceding whitespace. Capitalisation is all over the place. I guess I'll never know.
