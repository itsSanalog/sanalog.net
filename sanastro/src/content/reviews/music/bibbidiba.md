A short review covering Suisei's biggest hit, and its bassline.

# Background

*Bibbidiba* holds the record of most views on Hoshimachi Suisei's YouTube channel, surpassing Stellar Stellar, which had held the record since 2021, in just 63 days. As of writing this, the MV has over 115 million views, with nearly half that on Spotify. And it deserves all the fame! What a bop this song is. On top of that, I noticed some really cool details in this track that I had to talk about it, even though I don't usually write about single tracks.

The title *Bibbidiba* is a reference to *Bibbidi-Bobbidi-Boo* from Disney's 1950 *Cinderella*, aligning perfectly with its reveal during Suisei’s 6th anniversary concert, aptly titled *SheenderellaDay*.

Composed and written by Tsumiki (ツミキ), his impressive musical talent and outstanding attention to detail shines through in every second of the song. One element that particularly stood out to me is the dynamic evolution of the bassline as the song progresses.

# Bassline

In the intro, a mix of synth bass and slap bass is used, but something sounds off about the slap bass. I'm fairly certain it's VST. However it's made, it gives an effect of having poisitioned each and every note one by one, rather than recorded, if that makes sense.

Around the 28-second mark, the mood changes as the song enters its first verse. Here, it changes to a normal bass, but I think this is a VST too. This part too seems to be meticulously crafted one by one. It takes a massive amount of effort to create such a feeling while sounding natural by planting each bass note, but Tsumiki seems determined not to take any shortcuts, displaying what almost feels like craftsmanship.

In the chorus that starts around 45 seconds, the bass changes yet again, into something that's often seen in trap or drill. It seems like Tsumiki started with a sine wave synth and overlaid sub-bass peaks on top of it—a common technique used in trap music to produce a smoother bass texture. This hint of trap allows a surprising yet natural transition as the rap part comes at a 1:22 and the song completely switches to trap style. The flow of using the bass commonly used in trap then immediately moving onto trap is surely intentional, used to brilliant effect.

But that's not the end! Vibes shift from 1:47 as yet another genre swap occurs, this time to electronica. Despite lasting just around 8 seconds, the drums (especially hi-hat usage) makes it unmistakeable. Furthermore, the bass waveform morphs yet again, into a powerful and gritty saw bass.

Pause for a second and listen to the second chorus (1:55) again. There is something different from the first chorus, right? It's because the bass is played with one chord. In the first chorus, the bass matches the chord progression, but only D# is used in this part. Without a dedicated STT (Super Tsumiki Time) to act as a bridge, altering the bassline allows Tsumiki to use the second chorus as a bridge as well, to act as a build-up to the next part.

Interestingly, the original chorus' acoustic theme makes its return from 2:10, but in half-time. Prior to this, on beats 1, 2, 3, and 4, one beat was completed with one measure: kick-snare-kick-snare. From 2:10 on however, snares were added on beats 3 and 7 from beats 1 to 8, completing one beat with two bars.

# Ok I'll stop

And that's about it! While I could talk about the melody, lyrics, or the beautiful MV, I think the bassline alone is enough to illustrate how this song pushes the degree of perfection. Hopefully you can hear the depth and detail in composition that this song possesses, appreciating Tsumiki's delicate work and craftmanship. It's one of, if not the most carefully constructed songs I've listened to from Hololive. The level of completion and polish is so high, with incredible talent making these countless transitions sounds good and homogenous. *Stellar* job, Tsumiki and Suisei.
