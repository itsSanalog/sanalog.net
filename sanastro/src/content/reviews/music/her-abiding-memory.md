An unexpected and unknown embodiment of Shibuya-kei.

Pitcher56 is a Japanese Shibuya-kei band. All three members were medical school students at the time of release, and are currently doctors. There is almost no other information on them. Barely any physical releases. No live performances. As with most bands, music is the only thing they have left behind, bar a faint scent of nostalgia.

The mix and mastering isn't perfect. Raw recordings capturing even swallowing and saliva noises. Would I be weird for appreciating this? Film capturing those days raw stimulates nostalgia like spice.. old spice or whatever.

9 tracks.

# 1.2.3!

A very powerful jingle.

# Humming Word

Starts off with a weird sigh. Super airy/lispy vocals. An earworm. Switches to male vocals around 1:52.

# Dewy Roses

Rather unexpected lyrics. Guitar at 1:56 changes the water level vibes.

# Woman 〜Wの悲劇より〜

Electro?? Bonnie Tyler?? Perhaps true Shibuya-kei

# すじをえがく

A song that declares goodbye. Reminds me too much of Korean ballad. Rock is good. Gave it a three for lyrics, for without them this would be a two.

# Jump Out From The Bed

This would have made for an amazing session intro. Love the cheers.

# Love Letter -Original Version-

Bittersweet love.

# サヨナラマタイツカ

I really like these intros.

A confession to make: I discovered this album through the Weezer subreddit on a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/weezer/comments/1ao4a5f/" target="_blank" class="extlink">post</a> about albums that use the same typeface as Weezer does.

we can check in on 森田洋之 through Note. Guy still seems interested in the band he was in. They haven't disbanded, so anything is possible.
