An unexpected and unknown embodiment of Shibuya-kei.

A confession to make: I discovered this album through the Weezer subreddit on a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/weezer/comments/1ao4a5f/" target="_blank" class="extlink">post</a> about albums that use the same typeface as Weezer does.

Pitcher56 is a Japanese Shibuya-kei band, with almost no information about them. Barely any physical releases. No live performances. All three memebers were medical school students were medical school students at the time of release, and are currently doctors.
