An unexpected and unknown embodiment of Shibuya-kei.

Pitcher56 is a Japanese Shibuya-kei band. All three members were medical school students at the time of release, and are currently doctors. There is almost no other information on them. Barely any physical releases. No live performances. As with most bands, music is the only thing they have left behind, bar a faint scent of nostalgia.

9 tracks.

# 1.2.3!

The introduction to a lead track serves as the listener's gateway to the entire album—a critical first impression that can set the tone for the entire journey. This track begins with a xylophone melody that instantly evoked the nostalgic ring of school dismissal bells. This is followed up by a warping sound effect before catapulting the listener into an explosive chorus. Putting the chorus at the beginning of the song achieves instant immersion, especially when the chorus possesses such a powerful, addictive quality. This is obviously deliberate, and I have a hunch that they might have been inspired by <a href="https://faroutmagazine.co.uk/the-open-secret-to-the-beatles-catchiness/" target="_blank" class="extlink">the Beatles</a>. The chorus itself possesses similar musical traits to Japanese commercial jingles of the 90's—bright, unforgettable, and designed to lodge itself firmly in your ear. What follows creates a fascinating dynamic as the verse adopts a significantly more subdued tone. Interestingly, the lyrics reflect this as well, with the Japanese verses being poetic and melancholic in constrast to the very (literally) playful English chorus. The track is well balanced between the soothing vocals, bass, drums, keyboard, and quirky sound effects—highlighted in the layered build up after the instrumental bridge. Boasting a simple arrangement, the track ends with multiple replays of that addictive xylophone motif, after which the school bells announce that it's really time to go home.

If you listen to the track on loop, you will notice that the ending bells have one extra chime compared to the opening bells. The 'warping sound effect' sounds like a sped-up glissando with a few filters, but listening carefully, I noticed a click just before the warp starts.

# Humming Word

Starts off with a weird sigh. Super airy/lispy vocals. An earworm. Switches to male vocals around 1:52.

# Dewy Roses

Rather unexpected lyrics. Guitar at 1:56 changes the water level vibes.

# すじをえがく

A song that declares goodbye. Reminds me too much of Korean ballad. Rock is good. Gave it a three for lyrics, for without them this would be a two.

A confession to make: I discovered this album through the Weezer subreddit on a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/weezer/comments/1ao4a5f/" target="_blank" class="extlink">post</a> about albums that use the same typeface as Weezer does.

we can check in on 森田洋之 through Note. Guy still seems interested in the band he was in. They haven't disbanded, so anything is possible.

# Album score

The mix and mastering isn't perfect. Raw recordings capturing even swallowing and saliva noises. Would I be weird for appreciating this? Film capturing those days raw stimulates nostalgia like spice.. old spice or whatever.

Also, beautiful cover.
